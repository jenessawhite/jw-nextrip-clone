# JW Target Code Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses the Metro Transit Nextrip API to:

- Get a list of routes
- Choose a route, then it's direction
- View the stops for that route and direction

It uses axios for the API calls and react-router-dom for all the routing.

For this project I gave myself a time limit as to keep myself on a deadline. I did not implement any true design, in order to learn more about testing and attempt to implement that.
Not all of the tests pass, so that's something that I'd like to improve, as well as implement some design (because this thing is ugly and it hurts my FE dev heart).
